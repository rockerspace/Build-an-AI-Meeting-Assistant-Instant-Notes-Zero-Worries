Familiarize  with Whisper: Begin by exploring Whisper, an application that converts audio speech to text. Understand its features, functionality, and limitations to ensure accurate transcription capabilities.

Build an initial app using Gradio: Create a simple app with Gradio, a Python library for building web-based interfaces. This step introduces you to handling audio inputs and outputs, preparing you for more advanced functionality.

Develop a complete speech-to-text application: Leverage your knowledge of Whisper and Gradio to design a robust speech-to-text application. Ensure it supports multiple audio formats and is user-friendly.

Explore IBM watsonx.ai LLM: Familiarize yourself with IBM watsonx.ai large language models (LLMs) to add advanced natural language processing features. Use these capabilities to improve the app's handling of transcriptions, such as context-aware corrections.

Preprocess speech-to-text transcripts: Clean and preprocess the transcriptions generated by the app. This includes adding proper punctuation, correcting errors, and structuring the text for readability and further analysis.

Utilize PromptTemplate and Chain: Incorporate PromptTemplate and Chain (from LangChain) to create advanced workflows. Use these tools to extend the app's functionality, such as generating summaries, extracting key points, or translating transcriptions.

Integrate and finalize: Bring all components together—Whisper, Gradio, IBM watsonx.ai LLM, and PromptTemplate workflows—into a cohesive Gradio application. The final product should deliver an end-to-end solution for converting and processing audio into polished, usable text.
